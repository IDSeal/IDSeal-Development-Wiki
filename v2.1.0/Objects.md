## Introduction
The primary Object in Core is the Contact Objects. Most all other functions
are done through or with a Contact Object. 

In essence, Contacts have Subscriptions for a Product Bundle, which has Transactions 
charged (with Taxes applied) based on which BillingOption they have selected and
which Products they either have active or are going to be activating.
