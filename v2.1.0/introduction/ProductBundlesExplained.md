## Overview
A Product Bundle is a group of Products that will be offered to end users when they are signing up.
It also uses Billing Options to determine pricing options and restrictions during sign up.

A Product Bundle will also be used for creating special pricing options for Companies or Special Offers.

## Example Explained
In the example above, the Platinum and Platinum Plus Product Bundles are shown.
