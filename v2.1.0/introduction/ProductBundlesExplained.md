## Overview
In the old version of Core, Platinum and Platinum Plus were their own Products. This has now
changed slightly - now they are considered Product Bundles.

This is because in the new v2.1.0 system, we now have a more dynamic means of mixing and matching
the various services and purchasable options that we offer.

For this to work though, there is some verbiage changes for the third party services and integrations 
that we connect our customers too, such as Experian, ACN and AntiVirus. These are now called
the Products in our system, and what was Platinum and Platinum Plus are now called the Product
Bundles.

This way we can create a Product Bundle with any number of combinations of Products.
